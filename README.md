The main objectives of analysing a large basket data set are:

I. Sales data analysis: understanding of general sales performance and patterns.

II. Top selling and least selling products: Identify which products are driving sales and which are lagging.

III. Discount Analysis: Measure discounts offered on products and analyse their impact on sales.

IV. Handling missing values: Ensuring data quality by identifying and handling missing values appropriately.

V. Anomaly detection and handling: Identify and manage anomalies to maintain data integrity.

VI. Consumer Insights: Ratings and product reviews provide valuable feedback that can guide product improvements and marketing efforts.

VII. Data visualization: Create visual representations of data to better understand trends and insights.

Through systematic analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform strategic decision making, optimize inventory management, and enhance the overall shopping experience for consumers.
